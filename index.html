      <h1>Dragon Project Revisited and Reflection</h1>
      <p>My first thought when considering a re-do rather than a revisit would be that I would 
         absolutely organize my stylesheet better; it was more than confusing when I began to
         start on my corrections. My roommate provided me with some feedback: more pictures.
         He thought it would be nice if there more pictures behind the header, which I assumed
         he would say. At first I liked the plain black background, but after putting the picture
         of stars, I like the header much more. The other thing he wanted was exactly what we 
         talked about in class. He thought I should move the logo to where the words were. 
         However, he did not know how much painstaking work it would take to do that, but after
         asking for some help, it has been done successfully.</p>
      <p>One other thing that I added to my website in this revision is the feedback form found on
         the home page. I thought it would be nice if the user would be able to send me feedback and 
         automatically recieve an email. Everyone knows how frustrating it is to send a form and have to 
         guess it was recieved. Adding the form was much easier than adding the pictures suprisingly. The
         pictures brought on a lot of mental turmoil, but was eventually adverted after hours of looking at 
         inspect element. Praise be. Being patient with this process was probably what I did best overall.</p>
      <p>This class and this project has been very fun to me. I used to code in high school, and I
         missed the satisfaction of having my code work. So, despite being a political science
         major, I opted to take this class. And I am very happy I did. This was certainly my most
         enjoyable class this semester.</p>
  
      <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is an approach to developing on the Internet that prioritizes 
         content instead of design. After content is created in HTML, CSS and then JavaScript can 
         be added to enhance visuals and experience. There are many reasons why this is important
         in the modern web. The first reason is accessibility. In the old system of graceful 
         degredation, accessibility standards were not met. Old browsers were pushed to the back
         burner all the while design and content were intertwined, not allowing people who needed
         to remove the design to be able to do so. Progressive enhancment is the kind of development 
         we have learned in class-- HTML content before CSS. Here is a link to another article
         about progressive enhancement: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">
