        <h2 id="beginning"> What is the difference between a fruit and vegetable?</h2>
        
            <p>
                According to healthline.com, <q>A fruit develops from the flower of a plant, 
                while the other parts of the plant are categorized as vegetables.</q>
            </p>
        
        <h3 id="argument">The importance</h3>
        
            <p>
                This defintions has major implications: every single plant is a vegetable if
                it is not a fruit. So is a tree branch a vegetable? A pine needle? A whole tree?
                We will discuss and find out.
            </p>
        
        <h4 id="vegetables">What specificially is a vegetable?</h4>
        
            <p>
                Healthline.com gave these possible three characteristics of a vegetable:
            </p>
                
            <ol>
              <li>Roots</li>
              <li>Stems</li>
              <li>Leaves</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                That website has lots of contentious information, but it attempts to solve
                it by providing more specific definitions. Here is a quote from the author:
            </p>
            
            <blockquotes>Botanically, fruits contain seeds and come from the flower of a 
            plant, while the rest of the plant is considered a vegetable. In cooking, fruits 
            are considered to be sweet while vegetables are more savory. <br> 
            <cite> From healthline.com written by Rachael Link, MS, RD</cite></blockquotes>
            
            <p>
                So in sum--
                <dl>
                  <dt><strong>Vegetable</strong></dt>
                  <dd><em>Literally any part of plant that isnt a fruit.</em></dd>
        
                  <dt><strong>Fruit</strong></dt>
                  <dd><em>Things that come from flowers.</em></dd>
        
                  <dt><strong>Botanical Vegetable</strong></dt>
                  <dd><em>Traditonal food from a plant that is savory.</em></dd>
                  
                  <dt><strong>Botanical Fruit</strong></dt>
                  <dd><em>Traditional food from a flower that are sweet.</em></dd>

                Vegetables <strong><em>are</em></strong> all plants that are not fruits. Does
                that mean you should eat them? Maybe not-- you decide.
